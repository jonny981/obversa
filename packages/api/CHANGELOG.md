## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 909029f: Every engine takes `effort`, the reasoning level a step runs at, under that one name: on the engine, on an `agentJob`, on a workflow agent stage, and on each request. An engine whose tool has a setting passes the level through it unchanged; an engine whose tool has none refuses the option with a clear error instead of ignoring it. The level a step asked for is recorded with its identity, so a record shows the effort each attempt ran at.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 14f9f24: Engines run clean by default: your login and the repository's own setup stay in, and your own user-level settings, hooks, plugins, skills and MCP servers stay out, so a workflow behaves the same for everyone who runs it. Set `clean: false` to run the tool exactly as you run it. Grok has no clean mode and always runs on your setup; `clean: true` there throws with the reason. The engine conformance kit lets an engine declare clean mode unsupported, and a reduced declaration passes.

## 0.2.3

## 0.2.2

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Return structured feedback and a composed prompt from an interactive review surface to an agent. Human review can repeat until a person explicitly approves the work. Judges can ask a person to resolve a product decision before continuing.

  Run plain functions between workflow stages. Judge stop outcomes have the same meaning in workflows and dependency graphs.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- A review loop can stop on a judge's word instead of a count. A `workflow()` stage's `retry` field is now `refine`, and it takes a count or `judge(seat, { cap, questions })`: a seat that reads what the reviewer found and the rounds so far, and says whether another round is worth it. A block finding always goes back, the cap always ends the rounds, and every answer is a `refine:judge` event on the record. The same `judge()` value works on a `dag()`'s `maxKickbacks`. `stopQuestions()` is the default question set.

  A tool event carries the file, command, URL or pattern it acted on, so the run's page and the console print `tool Read use src/a.ts`. The run's page prints the record in the console's own words and shows the question's input and a link above the yes and no buttons. `renderRecord()`, `summarizeRecord()` and the `obversa-record` command print a run record as Markdown a person scans.
