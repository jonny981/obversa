### Minor Changes

- A review loop can stop on a judge's word instead of a count. A `workflow()` stage's `retry` field is now `refine`, and it takes a count or `judge(seat, { cap, questions })`: a seat that reads what the reviewer found and the rounds so far, and says whether another round is worth it. A block finding always goes back, the cap always ends the rounds, and every answer is a `refine:judge` event on the record. The same `judge()` value works on a `dag()`'s `maxKickbacks`. `stopQuestions()` is the default question set.

  A tool event carries the file, command, URL or pattern it acted on, so the run's page and the console print `tool Read use src/a.ts`. The run's page prints the record in the console's own words and shows the question's input and a link above the yes and no buttons. `renderRecord()`, `summarizeRecord()` and the `obversa-record` command print a run record as Markdown a person scans.
